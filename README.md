## Project Overview

The **Pizza Chain Sales Analytics** project is designed to analyze and visualize sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant chain. The goal is to gain insights that will help optimize operations, increase sales, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project employs SQL for data processing and Power BI for visualization.
